            I'm George, a software developer specialising in JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been building web apps since 2013. I started out with
            PHP/MySQL development and have spent the past eight years
            working with JavaScript and modern web technology, including
            React.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a strong knowledge of web accessibility, having
            worked on dozens of apps to improve accessibility for
            NatWest, the NHS, and UK government.

            I expanded our product range by brokering representation for

            the UK and Indonesia to discuss new products and prospects.
            In February 2014, I relocated to Johannesburg to open and
